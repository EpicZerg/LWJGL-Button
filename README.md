LWJGL-Button
============

Usage:
Create a new Button with the Following Syntax:
>Button name = new Button(topLeftX, topLeftY, Width, Height, Text);

And to draw it you just add:

`while(!Display.isCloseRequested){`

name.draw();

...

}

To see if its clicked just use this:

>if(name.isClicked()){...}


*Text is not working as of this Moment!
